# **STL-functions**  

**STL** is library in c++ which contains built in functions which are very useful for us to use. We don't have to make them on ourselves.  

This **repository** contains some basic **STL** **functions**.

**sort(a,a+n)** : This functions sort the array a with size n in ascending order.

**__gcd(a,b)** : This function returns the gcd of the two numbers a and b.

**vector\<int> v** : This declares vector in c++. Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. 

**s.size()** or **s.length()** : This function returns the size or length of the string s.   

**s.substr(i)** : This function returns the substring of string s from integer i.
